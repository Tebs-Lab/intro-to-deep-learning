    "# Collecting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data is hard. There's a reason why big corporations are in an arms race to have the biggest and best datasets. There is also a reason facial recognition software has been mired in controversy. In part due to its close connection with mathematics, data and AI systems have a reputation of being more objective and less biased than humans. In this section I want to caution against this view. Many AI systems have been shown to both adopt and amplify existing societal biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias can be injected into a deep learning system at multiple points throughout the development lifecycle. One of the biggest risks for any ML system is that the data itself encodes social biases. In this section we're going to discuss examples of how this has happened, and think about strategies for avoiding problems associated with the data collection process."

    "## Criticial Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class imbalance**: Amazon's technical workforce is skewed heavily towards men. A machine learning system trained on a random sample of Amazon engineers will get significantly more examples of men who got hired than women who got hired. The implicaction is a probability distribution that favors men. Think about it this way: if 90% of the \"good hire\" examples are men, then an ML model will very reasonabily learn to bet on men. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recreating the past**: There are a host of reasons women are underrepresented in the technology workforce. The past is biased, and our machine learning model is trained on historical data. If the training and test datasets both reflect a baised history, the model's predictions will reflect that history. Remember, our ML models are basically answering the question, \"Given the historical data we fed into you, what outcome do you expect on this new data?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Biased Evaluators**: The people evaluating the system were Amazon's mostly male engineering teams. Not that men cannot be impartial, but if the system demonstrates bias that the evaluators are used to, they might not recognize it as bias. Said another way, if 90% of your coworkers are men it might not surprise you when 90% of the predicted \"good hires\" are men. "

    " ### What to do about it?\n",
    " \n",
    " **Class imbalance**:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Collect more data! If you can collect more examples of the underrepresented class, you can balance out your dataset and make it reflect the outcomes you *want* not just the outcomes that already exist in the domain you're studying. \n",
    " * Change the performance metric. Focusing on alternate metrics like false positives, false negatives, precision, recall, F1 Score and Kappa can tease help a system perform better even with data that has imbalance. [Read about these metrics here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/)\n",
    " * Resample from the dataset to balance the classes. If you have enough samples, you can balance your classes by throwing out some of the overrepresented data points (called undersampling). If you're low on samples you can make duplicates of the underrepresented class (called oversampling). It may seem simplistic, but these tactics have both been shown to improve performance in some cases.  \n",
    " * Generate synthetic data to balance things out. SMOTE is a popular tactic for oversampling through the use of synthetic data, for example by using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique [SMOTE paper](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302). [Example of using SMOTE in Python](https://beckernick.github.io/oversampling-modeling/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recreating the Past**: When you're making a machine learning system make sure to ask yourself if the data you have represents the outcomes you want. In descriptive statistics we're seeking to *describe what the data says* but when we apply that mindset to predictive modeling, esp. if that model will be used to guide a decision making process, we have to ask ourselves: **If our model just recreates the status quo, is that good enough?** if not, you may need to think about using another tactic. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Biased Evaluators**: Make sure lots of people with different backgrounds evaluate the results of a model. This is what academic peer review has always sought to do, and while that system is not perfect, there is plenty of evidence that having challenging and genuine disagreements over any finding or result generally improves the quality of any resulting paper. For examples of this research read [Wikipedia and the Wisdom of Polarized Crowds](http://nautil.us/issue/70/variables/wikipedia-and-the-wisdom-of-polarized-crowds) If possible, have one or more 3rd party look at the results!
